# My Awesome Link Shortener

Hey there! üëã Welcome to my project. This isn't just any app; it's a full-fledged **URL shortener** (like Bitly) that I built from the ground up using some of the coolest modern web technologies. I poured my heart and soul into this project to make it fast, sleek, and functional.

I'm really proud of how it turned out, and I hope you find it useful!

## üöÄ What's Inside the Tech Stack?

I built this thing to be fast and modern. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the powerful tools I used:

*   **Next.js 15.5.2**: The core framework. I used it for its amazing React-based structure, super-fast server-side rendering, and simple page-based routing. It makes the whole app feel incredibly snappy.
*   **React 19.1.0**: For building all the interactive and dynamic components you see on the frontend. The latest React makes everything smooth and efficient.
*   **TailwindCSS v4**: For styling. I chose this because it lets me quickly design a modern and responsive UI without ever leaving my HTML/JSX. It's like having a design toolkit right at my fingertips.
*   **MongoDB (via `mongodb` driver 6.19.0)**: This is the database where all the shortened links and their original URLs are stored. It's a powerful and flexible NoSQL database that fits perfectly with a JavaScript-based app like this.
*   **Turbopack (`--turbopack` flag)**: This is the secret sauce for speed! It's a super-fast bundler and development tool that makes my code changes appear in the browser almost instantly. It makes the development experience buttery smooth.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Get It Running on Your Machine

Love the project and want to run it yourself? It's easy! Just follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the project** to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd my-app
    ```

2.  **Install all the necessary dependencies.** This will grab Next.js, React, Tailwind, and everything else the project needs.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables.** You'll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your MongoDB connection string so the app can talk to the database. It should look something like this:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string_here"
    ```

4.  **Fire up the development server!**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open your browser and go to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see the app live and ready to go!

### Other Useful Commands

*   `npm run build`: Creates an optimized production build of the app.
*   `npm start`: Starts the production server (run `npm run build` first).
